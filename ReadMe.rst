LazySearch
==============

Made for lazy people like me who want to share/watch videos for currently playing songs without having to put in much effort.

**How to use LazySearch**

Grab the applet from this repo and put it wherever your heart desires it to be on your computer.

Click to launch the applet and it Spotify is running LazySearch will pull up the YouTube search results for the song that is currently playing. If Spotify isn't running, it will let you know that too.
