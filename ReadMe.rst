LazySearch
==============

Made for lazy people like me who want to share/watch videos for currently playing songs without having to put in much effort.

**How to use LazySearch**

Grab the applet from this repo and put it wherever your heart desires it to be on your computer.

Click to run LazySearch, and if Spotify is running, LazySearch will pull up the YouTube search results for the song that is currently playing. If Spotify isn't running, it will let you know that too. 

When LazySearch is done searching for a song it will quit itself. To search for another currently playing song simply click the LazySearch shortcut again.

**Music applications compatible with LazySearch**

Currently LazySearch only handles searching for songs that are currently playing on Spotify. Future plans to add in iTunes. (When I'm feeling less lazy.)
